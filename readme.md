Notes:


### Done button issue
The iOS number pad keybaord does not have a 'done' button. In the Objective C
version of this app I created an InputAccessoryView with a 'done' button. I
don't think that's easily accomplished in React Native.

Maybe a better solution is presented here - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29685421/react-native-hide-keyboard

### no built-in React Native support for picker with multiple components

### no built in support for UITableView (ListView doable?)

# Notes to share with user

taxes? assume income grows with inflation. Dollar amounts are in today's earning potential
pre-tax, post-tax? assumes you have access to the cash at retirement (likely you'll have a mix of tax advantaged and non tax advantaged funds, or could use a roth conversion ladder). Tax gain harvesting to lower taxes. If you have a paid off house, you won't need as much money to live on and will be in a lower tax bracket. Don't plan for retirement based on your annual income, plan based on your annual spending. If you make 100000 today and save 40k, you only need to withdraw 60k to maintain the same lifestyle. You may need less than that because you'll be in a lower tax bracket and may not have any earned income.
