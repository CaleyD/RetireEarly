Notes:


### Done button issue
The iOS number pad keybaord does not have a 'done' button. In the Objective C
version of this app I created an InputAccessoryView with a 'done' button. I
don't think that's easily accomplished in React Native.

Maybe a better solution is presented here - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29685421/react-native-hide-keyboard

### no built-in React Native support for picker with multiple components

### no built in support for UITableView (ListView doable?)
